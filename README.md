# Mintlify - Intelligent Knowledge Platform Landing Page

This is a landing page clone of Mintlify website built with HTML and CSS. The project features a dark theme design showcasing an intelligent documentation platform.

## About Project

This is a static website that recreates the Mintlify homepage design. It uses HTML5 for structure and CSS3 for styling without any JavaScript frameworks. Google Material Icons and Inter font family are used throughout the page.

##  Structure

The project contains index.html for structure and style.css for all styling. The images folder contains company logos, feature screenshots, and background images organized in subfolders.

## Sections

The website includes a fixed navigation bar with logo and menu items. The hero section has a notification bar, heading, description, email input, and large feature image. A company logo grid displays eight major tech companies in four columns.

The intelligence features section contains three cards explaining platform capabilities. The enterprise section highlights partnership and compliance features with case study logos. The final section has call to action buttons and two information cards. The footer includes navigation links in five columns, social media icons, security badge, and theme toggle buttons.

## Design

The website uses a dark background with light text for contrast. CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for layouts. Absolute positioning controls section placement. All interactive elements have hover effects. The design includes green accent colors for labels and links.
